# HtmlView2

Cleaner, simplified and "Androidified" version of HtmlView .

- Custom text styling using Views in HtmlView1 replaced with Android spans.
- Layouts are now orthogonal to the view hierarchy (opposed to subclassing in HtmlView).
- Native views don't require wrapping.

## Restrictions

- No support for CSS floats
- CSSÂ can't override whether an element is a text or block element.

## Usage

For a simple example, please refer to the (demo)[
